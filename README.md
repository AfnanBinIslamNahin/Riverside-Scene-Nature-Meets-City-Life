# 🌆 Riverside Scene – Nature Meets City Life

A **Computer Graphics project** built using **C++ and OpenGL**, visualizing a beautiful riverside environment where **nature** blends seamlessly with **urban life**.  
This project demonstrates fundamental **computer graphics concepts** such as transformations, animations, and rendering techniques.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Dynamic day and night scene**
- Flowing **river animation** with boats and fishes
- **City skyline** with buildings and glowing windows
- Natural elements like **trees, clouds, sun, and moon**
- Smooth animations using `glutTimerFunc` and keyboard/mouse interactions
- Demonstrates basic **OpenGL primitives** and transformations
